I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I am an epidemiologist and biostatistician by training with expertise in infectious disease, violence, and causal inference. My recent projects include:

- Running randomized trials in Uganda and Peru testing social theories about how to reduce male violence.
- Improving postmarket evaluations of vaccine effectiveness from observational data.
- Developing Bayesian generative models of within-host viral and immune kinetics for SARS-CoV-2.
- Developing methods for validating counterfactual predictions.
- Descriptive epidemiology of global treatment patterns for cardiovascular disease with NCD-RisC.
