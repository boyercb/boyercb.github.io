I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and a staff Biostatistician at the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. 

My research focuses on methods for improving causal estimation and inference in observational and randomized studies. In the past, this has included work counterfactual prediction, postmarket vaccine evaluation, target trial emulation, and interference/spillover and placebo effects in randomized trials. At the Clinic, I collaborate with investigators at the Center for Value Based Care Research leveraging electronic medical records databases to evaluate comparative effectiveness of primary care and hospital-based interventions and as a platform for novel trial design to improve medical decision-making at the point of care.
