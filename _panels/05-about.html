	<h2>About</h2>
</header>
<p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a> where I work with the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu">causal inference group</a> and apply modern methods to answer causal questions in oberservational and experimental settings. My current substantive focus is on the epidemiology of violence in developing countries. With Jeannie Annan, Lori Heise, Betsy Paluck, and Jasper Cooper, I am running a large field randomized evaluation of an anti-violence intervention in Uganda. I also have a Master's degree in Public Health from Columbia and a Bachelor's degree in Mechinal Engineering from Wright State University</p>
<p>Prior to pursuing a PhD, I worked at <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org">Innovations for Poverty Action</a> as a technical advisor on several large-scale randomized controlled trials of high-profile development programs in <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/study/debates-impact-voter-knowledge-initiatives-sierra-leone">education</a>, <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/study/debates-impact-voter-knowledge-initiatives-sierra-leone">politics</a>, <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/study/girl-empowerment-rural-liberia">violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/study/interpersonal-communication-encourage-use-female-condoms-zambia">reproductive health</a>. My wife and I met while serving as Peace Corps Volunteers in Mozambique from 2010 to 2012.</p>
