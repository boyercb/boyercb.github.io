    "text": "The generative model\nA few quick preliminaries, let \\(V_t\\) be the true value of the outcome and \\(V^*_t\\) the observed value both index by time \\(t\\) which is centered at the highest observed value. We’ll assume that, within individuals, the trajectory of the true value is well-approximated by the piece-wise exponential function \\[\n\\log V_t = g(t; \\theta),\n\\] where \\[\ng(t; \\theta) = \\begin{cases}\n   \\dfrac{\\delta}{\\omega_p} (t - (t_p - \\omega_p)) & \\text{if } t \\leq t_p \\\\\n    \\delta - \\dfrac{\\delta}{\\omega_r} (t - t_p) & \\text{if } t &gt; t_p,\n\\end{cases}\n\\] This is essentially a triangle on the log scale with parameters, \\(\\theta = (t_p, \\omega_p, \\delta_p, \\omega_r)\\), governing the time of the peak (\\(t_p\\)), the peak height (\\(\\delta_p\\)), and the rise (\\(\\omega_p\\)) and fall times (\\(\\omega_r\\)).\nWe start by including classical measurement error and assume observed values are normal deviates (on the log scale) about the truth, i.e. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\log V^*_t &= \\log V_t + \\varepsilon \\\\\n  \\varepsilon &\\sim N(0, \\sigma)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] In reality these errors are probably not homoskedastic, but for now this is a reasonable approximation.\nTo incorporate the lower limit of detection of the test, we assume values below the limit are censored such that the distribution function becomes \\[\nf(\\log v^*_t ; \\log v_t, \\sigma) = \\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\exp\\left\\{-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{\\log v^*_t-\\log v_t}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right\\} & \\text{if }v^*_t &gt; lod \\\\\n\\Phi(\\log v^*_t) & \\text{if } v^* \\leq lod\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(\\Phi(\\cdot)\\) is the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution. Here we assume that \\(lod\\) is a known fixed value determined by the design of the test and therefore is not a parameter to be estimated from the data. For brevity, we define \\(N(\\log v_t, \\sigma)_{lod}\\) to be the distribution with this distribution function.\nFinally, we include the possibility of false positive and false negatives by assuming the observed is actually drawn from a mixture \\[\nf(\\log v^*_t ; \\log v_t, \\sigma) = \\begin{cases}\np \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}}\\exp\\left\\{-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{\\log v^*_t-\\log v_t}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right\\} + (1-p)& \\text{if }v^*_t &gt; lod \\\\\n\\Phi(\\log v^*_t) & \\text{if } v^* \\leq lod\n\\end{cases}\n\\] \\[\n\\log V^*_t \\sim \\lambda_1 N(\\log V_t, \\sigma)_{lod} + \\lambda_2 Exp(\\mu) + \\lambda_3 \\mathbb I(\\log V^*_t = lod)\n\\] where \\(\\lambda_1\\), \\(\\lambda_2\\), and \\(\\lambda_3\\) are the mixture probabilities denoting when the observed is drawn from the censored classical measurement error distribution (\\(\\lambda_1\\)) or is a false positive (\\(\\lambda_2\\)) or a false negative (\\(\\lambda_3\\)). We assume false positives are exponentially distributed with most of the mass near the limit of detection. False negatives will always have observed values at the lower limit of detection, so here we use the Dirac delta function, \\(\\delta_{V^*_t}(\\cdot)\\), to represent a point mass at the limit.\n\nfunctions {\n  // This function calculates a piece-wise exponential function.\n  // t: The time variable.\n  // tp: The peak time.\n  // wp: The width of the peak.\n  // wr: The width of the right side of the function.\n  // dp: The depth of the peak.\n  real pefun(real t, real tp, real wp, real wr, real dp) {\n    if (t &lt;= tp) {\n      return dp / wp * (t - (tp - wp)); // Viral load rises before peak\n    } else {\n      return dp - dp / wr * (t - tp); // Viral load falls after peak\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ndata {\n  int&lt;lower=0&gt; N;                   // sample size\n  vector[N] v_obs;                  // observed outcome\n  vector[N] t;                      // time\n  real lod;\n}\n\nparameters {\n  real dp;\n  real wp;\n  real wr;\n  real tp;\n  simplex[3] lambda;\n  real sigma;\n}\n\nmodel {\n   // PRIORS\n   beta_t ~ normal(0, 10);\n   beta_c ~ normal(0, 10);\n   alpha_t_raw ~ normal(0, 1);\n   alpha_c_raw ~ normal(0, 1);          \n\n   // LIKELIHOOD \n   for (n in 1:N) {\n     real v = pefun(n, tp, wp, wr, dp);\n     \n     if (v_obs[n] == lod) {\n       target += log_sum_exp(\n         log(lambda),\n         log1m(lambda) + normal_lcdf(lod | v, sigma)\n       )\n     } else {\n       target += log_sum_exp(\n         log(lambda[1]) + normal_lpdf(v_obs[n] | v, sigma), \n         log(lambda[2]) + exponential_lpdf(0 | mu),\n         log(lambda[3]) + dirac\n       )\n     }\n   }\n   y ~ normal(alpha + tau * a + beta_t * a + beta_c * (1 - a), sigma_t * a + sigma_c * (1 - a));\n}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "We’ve all been there. Just working away on some tricky causal question, minding your own damn business, thinking maybe… just maybe… this time you’ve discovered some new insight and BAM! You realize that it was already covered in Robins 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin’s g-computation algorithm, or as it is more commonly known, the g-formula, identifies the causal effect of a time-fixed or time-varying treatment under certain assumptions. It has been used to estimate the effects of interventions on coronary heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, mortality, and HIV.\nThe g-formula has several algebraically equivalent representations, namely:\n\nNon-iterated conditional expectation (NICE)\nIterated conditional expectation (ICE)\nInverse probability weighted expectation (IPW)\n\n\nSetup and identification\nTo fix concepts, let’s start with the simple case of a single, binary, time-fixed treatment, \\(A\\), for which we have an outcome, \\(Y\\), measured at the end of follow up as well as covariates \\(L\\) which potentially confound the relationship between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\). We’d like to estimate the effect of \\(A\\) on \\(Y\\). To help, we define \\(Y^a\\) as an individual’s potential outcome under an intervention which sets \\(A\\) to \\(a\\). Our interest then is in causal effects such as the average treatment effect, i.e. \\[E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\] which can be expressed as a contrast between potential outcomes under different values of treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA directed acyclic graph for a single, time-fixed treatment.\n\n\n\nTo identify effects, we require the following assumptions\n\nExchangeability: \\[Y^{a} \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A \\mid L\\]\nConsistency: \\[Y^{a} = Y \\text{  if } A = a\\]\nPositivity: \\[1 &gt; \\Pr(A = a \\mid L = l) &gt; 0\\]\n\nThese assumptions are described in exquisite detail in Hernan and Robins, but briefly: the first assumption implies that, conditional on \\(L\\), those who aretreated and untreated are exchangeable with respect to \\(Y\\). Graphically, this condition implies that all backdoor paths between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) are blocked by conditioning on \\(L\\), with the crucial assumption being that there are no unmeasured variables \\(U\\) which are related to both \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) that don’t pass through \\(L\\). The second assumption, consistency, implies that an individual’s observed outcome who received treatment \\(A = a\\) is in fact their potential outcome \\(Y^a\\). While this may seem tautological it may be violated if for instance there are hidden versions of treatment, such as when treatment is ill-defined or when there are network effects such that an individual’s potential outcome is affected by the treatment status of others. Finally, the third assumption, positivity, states that there must be a non-zero probability of observing treatment level \\(A = a\\) within all strata of \\(L\\).\nUnder these assumptions \\(E(Y^a)\\), the mean potential outcome under an intervention that sets \\(A\\) to \\(a\\), is identified by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(Y^{a}) &\\overset{(1)}{=} \\sum_{l} E(Y^{a} \\mid L = l) \\Pr(L = l) \\\\\n&\\overset{(2)}{=} \\sum_{l} E(Y^{a} \\mid A = a, L = l) \\Pr(L = l) \\\\\n&\\overset{(3)}{=} \\sum_{l} E(Y \\mid A = a, L = l) \\Pr(L = l)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the first line follows from the law of total probability, the second from the independence between \\(Y^a\\) and \\(A\\) after conditioning on \\(L\\), and the third from the consistency of potential outcomes. \\[\nE^{G,a'}(Y) = \\sum_{l} E(Y \\mid A = a', L = l) \\Pr(L = l)\n\\] This is the NICE representation of the g-formula and is perhaps the most well-known. It suggests that the mean potential outcome \\(E(Y^a)\\) is equal to the mean observed outcome among those with observed \\(A\\) equal to \\(a\\) within strata of covariates \\(L\\), necessary to ensure exchangeability, and then standardized tothe marginal (population) distribution of \\(L\\).\nHowever, as shown in the appendix, by applying the rules of probability we find that the NICE expression is also equal to \\[E_{L}\\{E(Y \\mid A = a, L = l)\\}\\] as well as \\[E\\left\\{\\frac{I(A = a)}{\\Pr(A = a \\mid L = l)} Y\\right\\}\\] where the first is the ICE representation of the g-formula, a sequence of iterated expectations with the inner most conditional on the observed treatment \\(A\\) and covariates \\(L\\) and the outer with respect to \\(L\\). The second expression is the IPW representation which weights the outcome in those observed to have \\(A = a\\) by the inverse of the probability of receiving treatment level \\(a\\) conditional on \\(L\\).\n\n\nNonparametric estimation\nIf they are all algebraically equivalent why go through all the fuss? Can’t we just pick one and stick with it? In this section, we’ll see that when \\(A\\) and \\(L\\) are low-dimensional and/or have just a few discrete levels, we can plug-in nonparametric estimates of the components of each and all three estimators will yield the same result, in which case this sentiment may be valid. However, for most real-world applications \\(A\\) and \\(L\\) will be high-dimensional and/or include continuous variables and therefore we will have to specify models for the components, in which case they may diverge in which case each estimator may have different properties.\nTo illustrate, consider a two-time point sequentially randomized trial in which \\(A_0\\), \\(L_1\\), and \\(A_1\\) are binary variables such that we have 8 possible treatment and covariate strata, which can be summarized succinctly in the following Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(A_0\\)\n\\(L_1\\)\n\\(A_1\\)\n\\(E(Y\\mid A_0, L_1, A_1)\\)\n\\(N\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n50\n6000\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n70\n2000\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n200\n2000\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n220\n6000\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n230\n3000\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n250\n1000\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n130\n3000\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n110\n9000\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of observations in each strata and \\(E(Y \\mid A_0, L_1, A_1)\\) is the mean outcome in each strata. We’ll ignore sampling variability for now and consider the 32,000 people in this study to constitute the full population. We’d like to estimate the effect comparing the average potential outcomes if everyone were always treated versus never treated, i.e. \\[E(Y^{1,1}) - E(Y^{0,0})\\] To do so, we’ll need estimates of the marginal potential outcomes \\(E(Y^{1,1})\\) and \\(E(Y^{0,0})\\) which are identified by the g-formula. For now let’s focus on \\(E(Y^{1,1})\\) because, once we see an example, obtaining the other is trivial. In this case, because \\(A_0\\), \\(L_1\\), and \\(A_0\\) are low dimensional, we can estimate the NICE, ICE, and IPW representations of the g-formula directly by plugging in estimates of their components.\nFirst, for the NICE plug-in estimator we need estimates of \\(E(Y \\mid A_0 = 1, L_1, A_1 = 1)\\) and \\(\\Pr(L_1 \\mid A_0 = 1)\\). The former can be read directly from the table, the latter we can calculate from the numbers in each strata, i.e. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(Y^{1,1}) &= \\sum_{l_1}E(Y \\mid A_1 = 1, L_1=l_1, A_0 = 1) \\Pr(L_1 = l_1 \\mid A_0 = 1) \\\\\n&=110 \\cdot \\Pr(L_1 = 1 \\mid A_0 = 1) + 250 \\cdot \\Pr(L_1 = 0 \\mid A_0 = 1) \\\\\n&= 110 \\cdot \\frac{9000 + 3000}{9000 + 3000 + 1000 + 3000} + 250 \\cdot \\frac{1000 + 3000}{9000 + 3000 + 1000 + 3000} \\\\\n&= 145\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] For the ICE plug-in estimator, we again need estimates of \\(E(Y \\mid A_0 = 1, L_1, A_1 = 1)\\), but this time we’ll take a slightly different approach and to estimate the iterated expectation we’ll take a weighted average of the result over the distribution of \\(L_1\\) given \\(A_0 = 1\\), i.e. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(Y^{1,1}) &= E_{L_1}\\{E(Y \\mid A_1 = 1, L_1=l_1, A_0 = 1) \\mid A_0 = 1\\} = \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n I(A_0 = 1)} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\bigg\\{ E(Y \\mid A_1 = 1, L_1=1, A_0 = 1) I(A_0 = 1, L_1 = 1) \\\\\n&\\qquad + E(Y \\mid A_1 = 1, L_1=0, A_0 = 1) I(A_0 = 1, L_1 = 1)\\bigg\\} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{16000} \\{110 \\cdot (9000 + 3000) + 250 \\cdot (1000 + 3000)\\}\\\\\n&= 145\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Finally for the IPW estimator, we need estimates of the probabilities of treatment given the past, \\(\\Pr(A_1 = 1 \\mid L_1, A_0 = 1)\\) and \\(\\Pr(A_0 = 1)\\), which again we can calculate directly from the number in each strata. We then estimate the weighted expectation of the outcome weighted by the inverse probabilities of treatment, i.e. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(Y^{1,1}) &= E\\left\\{ \\frac{I(A_0 = 1, A_1 = 1)}{\\Pr(A_1 = 1 \\mid L_1 = l_1, A_0 = 1) \\Pr(A_0 = 1)} Y\\right\\} = \\\\\n&\\quad= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\bigg\\{ \\frac{I(A_0 = 1, L_1 = 1, A_1 = 1)}{\\Pr(A_1 = 1 \\mid L_1 = 1, A_0 = 1) \\Pr(A_0 = 1)} Y \\\\\n&\\quad\\quad + \\frac{I(A_0 = 1, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 1)}{\\Pr(A_1 = 1 \\mid L_1 = 0, A_0 = 1) \\Pr(A_0 = 1)} Y\\bigg\\} \\\\\n&\\quad= \\frac{1}{32000}\\left\\{ \\frac{9000}{1/2 \\cdot 3/4}110 + \\frac{1000}{1/2 \\cdot 1/4}250\\right\\}\\\\\n&\\quad= \\frac{1}{32000}\\left\\{ (24000)110 + (8000) 250\\right\\}\\\\\n&\\quad= 145\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Pr(A_1 = 1 \\mid L_1 = 1, A_0 = 1) = \\frac{9000}{12000} = \\frac{3}{4}\\), \\(\\Pr(A_1 = 1 \\mid L_1 = 0, A_0 = 1) = \\frac{1000}{4000} = \\frac{1}{4}\\), and \\(\\Pr(A_0 = 1) = \\frac{16000}{32000} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\nAs expected the estimates from these three approaches coincide exactly when nonparametric estimation is feasible.\n\n\nParametric estimation\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_{\\overline{a}_k}(\\overline{l}_k) &= E(Y \\mid \\overline{A}_k = \\overline{a}_k, \\overline{L}_k = \\overline{l}_k) \\\\\n\\lambda(\\overline{l}_k) &= \\Pr(L_k = l_k \\mid \\overline{A}_{k-1} = \\overline{a}_{k-1}, \\overline{L}_{k-1} = \\overline{l}_{k-1}) \\\\\n\\pi(\\overline{l}_k) &= \\Pr(A_k = 1 \\mid \\overline{A}_{k-1} = \\overline{a}_{k-1}, \\overline{L}_k = \\overline{l}_k)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\\sum_{\\forall \\overline{l}_K}\\mu_{\\overline{a}_K}(\\overline{l}_K; \\widehat{\\beta}) \\prod_{i=1}^K \\lambda(\\overline{l}_i; \\widehat{\\gamma})\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mu_{a_0}(\\ldots \\mu_{a_{K-1}}(\\mu_{\\overline{a}_K}(\\overline{l}_K; \\widehat{\\beta}_K), \\overline{l}_{K-1}; \\widehat{\\beta}_{K-1})\\ldots, l_0; \\widehat{\\beta}_0)\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{I(\\overline{A}_K = \\overline{a}_K)}{\\prod_{i=1}^K\\pi(\\overline{l}_i; \\widehat{\\delta})} Y\\]\n\n\nSimulation\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL_0 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 1) \\\\\nA_0 &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\operatorname{expit}\\{-3 + L_0 + I(L_0 &gt; 1)\\}) \\\\\nL_1 &\\sim \\text{Normal}(L_0 - A_0, 1) \\\\\nA_1 &\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\operatorname{expit}\\{-3 + 5 A_0 + L_1 + I(L_1 &gt; 1) + I(L_0 &gt; 1)\\}) \\\\\nY &\\sim \\text{Normal}(L_1 + L_0 - A_0 - A_1 - 0.5 A_0 A_1, 1) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[E(Y^{1, 1} - Y^{0, 0}) = -3.5\\]\nLet’s begin by simulating data from the generative model above in R.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{boyer2024,\n  author = {Boyer, Christopher},\n  title = {The Many Faces of the g-Formula},\n  date = {2024-02-16},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBoyer, Christopher. 2024. “The Many Faces of the\ng-Formula.” February 16, 2024."
