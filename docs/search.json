My work spans several topics in epidemiology and the social sciences, but it is united by an interest in careful design and causal inference. Currently, this includes:\nRunning randomized controlled trials in Uganda and Peru testing social theories about how to reduce male violence.\nTheorizing about the effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDeveloping methods for time-dependent risk prediction using the g-formula.\nIn this, I am aided by a fantastic, multi-displinary set of collaborators and mentors who keep me sane and are an endless source of good ideas. When not writing or coding, I enjoy baking and spending time with my wife, Jama, and our cantankerous feline, Ursula üòº.\nEducation\nPhD Candidate, Epidemiology, Harvard University, 2022 (expected).\nMS Biostatistics, Harvard University, 2022 (expected).\nMPH Epidemiology, Columbia University, 2015.\nBS Mechanical Engineering, Wright State University, 2010.\nExperience\nResearch Analyst.
