I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health. My work spans several topics in epidemiology and the  social sciences, but it is united by an interest in careful design and causal inference. Currently, this includes:

- Running randomized controlled trials in Uganda and Peru testing social 
theories about how to reduce male violence.
- Developing methods for factual and counterfactual risk prediction.
- Emulating postexposure vaccination trials from observational data.
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling of the viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2.
- Descriptive epidemiology of global treatment patterns in statin use with NCD-RisC.

In this, I am aided by a fantastic, multi-disciplinary set of collaborators and mentors who keep me sane and are an endless source of good ideas. When not writing or coding, I enjoy baking and spending time with my wife, Jama, our son, Bruno, and our cantankerous feline, Ursula ðŸ˜¼.
