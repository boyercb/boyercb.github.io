I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health. My work spans several topics in epidemiology and the 
social sciences, but it is united by an interest in careful design and causal
inference. Currently, this includes:

- Running randomized controlled trials in Uganda and Peru testing social 
theories about how to reduce male violence.
- Theorizing about the effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
- Developing methods for time-dependent risk prediction using the g-formula.

In this, I am aided by a fantastic, multi-displinary set of collaborators and
mentors who keep me sane and are an endless source of good ideas. When not
writing or coding, I enjoy baking and spending time with my wife, Jama, and our
cantankerous feline, Ursula ðŸ˜¼.
